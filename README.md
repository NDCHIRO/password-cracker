# password-cracker
 its not very strong password cracker.
 assume you are given a hashed password (SHA-1) and you want to get the real word so there was a list of common words and passwords.
 the hashed password is compared with this list after the list is hashed with SHA-1
if the hashed password is equal to a hashed word in the list, the code returns the real word
